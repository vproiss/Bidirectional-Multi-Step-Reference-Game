# Emergent Language in Multi-Step Bidirectional Reference Game

## Description

## Project Set-Up

1. Setting up the environment. 
    * Recreate the environment: ``conda env create --name myenv --file environment.yml``
    * Activate conda env: ``conda activate --name``

2. ``data/`` and ``results/`` folders are pushed with ``.gitignore`` since the files are too large.

3. Reposetory strucure.

    | processed_data

| utils
    data_loader.py ---> loads COCO captions dataset, extracts features with ResNet50, 
                        and saves `train`, `test` and `val` datasets as `{ds}.tfrecord` files.

4. How to start the project.
    * [optional] Run `python3 utils/data_loader.py` to load the COCO caption dataset (requires at least 60 GB of free disk space). You may skip this step â€“ extracted features are already saved under `data/processed_data` and will be further used in this project.

    * Run `python3 main.py` to execute the whole project:
        - `data_preprocessor.py` creates `R1` and `R2` image feature subsets along with one-hot encoded target vectors `t1` and `t2` that the model will be trained on;
        - `agent.py` runs the agent models;
        - `communication.py` is responsible for agent communication;
        - `training.py` is for training as well as evaluaton the test and validation datasets. It will also produce visualizations.
        - `args.py` sets the hyperparameters as lerning rate, number of epochs and batch sizes;
        - `settings.py` you can manually adjust other model parameters, such as embedding_size, scaling_factor, etc.
